# Auto-GCAS

This study is prepared for the completion of my undergraduate studies at Istanbul Medipol University, Department of Management Information Systems. This study investigates the development and implementation of Auto-GCAS on HÜRJET in order to increase pilot safety in the aviation industry and to promote progress in the Turkish aviation industry.

Supported by the Turkish Aerospace Lift Up industry-oriented bachelor dissertation program, this study focuses on the development of the Auto-GCAS, which is designed to detect and prevent collisions with natural or man-made obstacles such as mountains or buildings when the aircraft, under the pilot's control, is in a situation unknown to the pilot. Preventing accidents resulting from hazardous situations unnoticed by the pilot is of paramount importance to ensure the safety of both pilots and aircraft. The development of Auto-GCAS aims to prevent events such as CFIT and reduce pilot losses. It is known that the Auto-GCAS algorithm and controller design, currently implemented in F-16s, have also been integrated into F-22 and F-35 aircraft. Incorporation of the Auto-GCAS into the HÜRJET, a turbofan-powered, advanced jet training, and close air support aircraft being developed by Turkish Aerospace is intended to enhance safety standards in the Turkish aviation industry. Through simulation-based development and modeling, HÜRJET pilots will be able to benefit from a system that automatically intervenes when they encounter hazardous situations.

The Python script 'run_GCAS_anim3d.py', essential for executing the simulation and obtaining outputs, has been uploaded. The academic paper authored and published by Turkish Aerospace Industries has been made available and uploaded. Due to confidentiality agreements with Turkish Aerospace Industries, the complete simulation has not been publicly disclosed. Furthermore, in adherence to data protection protocols safeguarding personal information, the thesis document of my undergraduate studies at Istanbul Medipol University, Department of Management Information Systems itself has not been uploaded.
