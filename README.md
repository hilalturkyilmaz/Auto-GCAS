# Auto-GCAS

This study was prepared for the completion of my undergraduate studies at **Istanbul Medipol University**, Department of **Management Information Systems**. The research investigates the development and implementation of **Auto-GCAS** on the **HÜRJET** aircraft to enhance pilot safety in the aviation industry and promote progress in the Turkish aviation sector.

Supported by the **Turkish Aerospace Lift Up** industry-oriented bachelor dissertation program, this study focuses on the development of **Auto-GCAS** (Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System). The system is designed to detect and prevent collisions with natural or man-made obstacles, such as mountains or buildings, when the aircraft, under the pilot's control, enters an unforeseen situation. Preventing accidents caused by hazardous situations that go unnoticed by the pilot is crucial to ensure the safety of both pilots and aircraft.

The development of **Auto-GCAS** aims to prevent events such as **CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain)** and reduce pilot casualties. The Auto-GCAS algorithm and controller, currently implemented in **F-16** aircraft, have been integrated into the **F-22** and **F-35** as well. Incorporating Auto-GCAS into the **HÜRJET**, a turbofan-powered advanced jet training and close air support aircraft developed by **Turkish Aerospace**, will further enhance safety standards in the Turkish aviation industry.

Through simulation-based development and modeling, **HÜRJET** pilots will benefit from a system that automatically intervenes when they encounter hazardous situations, thereby improving flight safety.
